This project adds syntax highlighting files for languages used by SocketStream (Jade, Stylus, CoffeeScript) to Gedit or a gtksourceview text editor.

### Installation and Use

1. Download and place all .lang files in `/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs` or `/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs` for Ubuntu 11.10

2. Restart or run Gedit and open any of the files included in your SocketStream project.

3. Of course, this isn't just limited to SocketStream, but that's why I made it.
